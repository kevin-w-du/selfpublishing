After I have self-published the second edition of my book titled
\textit{Computer \& Internet Security: A Hands-on Approach}, 
many of my friends asked me for the experience, as well as for 
the template of my files. I decide to write about my experience in 
a book form, with all the source files shared via GitHub, so 
readers can use the same template for their book.
