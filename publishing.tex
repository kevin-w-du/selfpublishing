\section{Self-Publishing In Other Countries}

Self-publishing in other countries may not be allowed, 
I only know a little bit about China from the Internet.



\subsection{Working with a Publisher}

To publish your book in another country, you may need to work
with a publisher if self-publishing is not allowed. When you sign
the contract, you need to remember that you are not only representing the author, 
you are also representing a
publisher (which is yourself). Most publishers may not realize that they 
are dealing with a publisher, so their contracts may not correctly reflect the fact. 
For example, the contract may ask you to grant them exclusive world-wide publishing rights. 
If you grant that, you may lose your self-publishing right.  
When I negotiated with a publisher in China, I have requested to add two restrictions in the 
contract: (1) the publisher can only publish the book in the Chinese language, 
and it does not have rights to publish the book in other languages. 
(2) The publisher can only publish the book in China. 
The publisher did accept my term. 


I am not a lawyer or expert on this issue, so do not treat my suggestions as 
legal advices. They are based on my common sense, so 
feel free to send me corrections if they are incorrect.
