# How I Self-Published My Books

I have published several computer books using self-publishing. Many friends
asked me to share my experience and resources with them. I am using this public
GitHub repository for that purpose. This document is written in a form of book,
using the same template used by my published books. Readers can use the same
template for their books if they want.
